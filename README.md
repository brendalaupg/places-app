# Limitations & Future Enhacements
- Due to time constaints, some UX was left out:
  - Zoom into Region with markers, when the search function finds places to pin on the map
  - displaying error / empty state when searching for results
  - clearing the markers
- In addition, here would we some additional functions for future enhancements:
  - network connectivity banner
  - description card for places (photo, full address, type of place)
  - tags (e.g. Restaurant, Gas Station, etcs) for enhancing the search results
